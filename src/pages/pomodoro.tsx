        Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco
        Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique is named after the Italian word
        for &quot;tomato&quot; (pomodoro), as a timer is typically used to keep
        track of the work intervals. The Pomodoro Technique is based on the idea
        that it is easier to sustain focus for short periods of time, and that
        taking regular breaks can help to improve overall productivity. The
        technique involves working for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break.
        This cycle is repeated 4 times, after which a longer break of 15-20
        minutes is taken. There are a number of different ways to use the
        Pomodoro Technique, and it can be customized to fit each person&apos;s
        needs. There are also a number of different tools and apps that can be
        used to help with time.
